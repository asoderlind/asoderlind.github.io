# Why write?

I think any kind of creative endeavor, whether it be painting, drawing, or composing, has the potential to be extremely fulfilling and worthwile. Especially in an age where consumption is rampant. I'm not saying this is a hot take, it might even be seen as an ice-cold take, but it's something worth talking more about (absolutely not me thinking up some grand justification for a stupid blog post, noo).

Not only is engaging in creativity by creating these things that stem from your imagination, but also failing, re-doing, iterating, and sharing. There is something deeply statisfying that comes from materializing something that was once only a thought in your head, or even just looking back on yourself a year a go and seeing the long path with a birds-eye view. Granted, straying away from all kinds of instant gratifications require effort, but it's a well placed effort.
