# Why write?

I think any kind of creative endeavor, whether it be painting, drawing, or composing, has the potential to be extremely fulfilling and worthwile. Especially in an age where consumption is rampant. I'm not saying this is a hot take, it might even be seen as an ice-cold take, but it's something worth talking more about (absolutely not me thinking up some grand justification for a stupid blog post, noo).

There is something deeply statisfying that comes from materializing something that was once only a thought in your head, or even just looking back on yourself a year a go and seeing the long path with a birds-eye view. Granted, pursuing this means spending less time on other things, which may or may not be a challenge. Straying away from any kind of instant gratification requires effort, but it's a well placed effort.

That's why I'm going to try at least to put some of my thoughts into words, for anyone that wants to read them, but also for myself. Because creating things is fun.
